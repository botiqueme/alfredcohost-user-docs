# Manage subscriptions

For Alfred Co.Host to respond on behalf of a property, **each property must have an active subscription**.

**Subscriptions** can be monthly or yearly and are billed in advance using the payment card you’ve associated. Billing is automatic.

When a property is subscribed, an AI assistant dedicated to that property is always available to interact with your guests.

## Activate a subscription

To activate a subscription, go to **My properties**, find the property you want to activate, toggle **Go live**, and choose your plan.

The assistant goes live instantly after activating.

## Cancel a subscription 

You can cancel a subscription at any time. To do so, go to **My subscriptions**, find the subscription you want to cancel, and click **Delete**.

When you cancel a subscription, it will **remain active until the end of the current billing cycle**. During this time, your assistant stays live. After that, the subscription will not renew and the assistant will be unpublished.

> **NOTE** Canceling a subscription **does not** delete the associated property or its information. For more, see [how to delete a property]().

> **NOTE** Deleted one by mistake? You can simply [subscribe again](#activate-a-subscription).
