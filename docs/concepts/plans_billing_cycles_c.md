# Plans & Billing Cycles

When choosing a plan on [our pricing page](https://alfredhospitalityai.com/pricing/), you can select a **billing cycle** — either **monthly** or **yearly** — for any of the available plans: **Essential Concierge** or **Premium Host**.

## Free Trial

Your first subscription includes a **15-day free trial**. At the end of the trial, your selected billing cycle will start automatically and be billed to the card you used when subscribing.

> **NOTE** You won’t be charged during the trial period. The first payment is made automatically when the trial ends.

## Billing cycles across properties

You can subscribe **each property individually with its own plan and billing cycle**.  
For example, one property can be on a monthly Essential plan, another on a yearly Premium plan. — it's fully flexible.

When subscribing an additional property to an existing billing cycle, you’ll only pay a **prorated amount**. The new property’s billing cycle automatically aligns with the existing one.  

For example, if your first property renews on **Jan 31**, and you subscribe a second one on **Jan 28**, you’ll pay a prorated amount for the remaining 3 days, and both properties will renew together.

## Changing plans & billing cycles

Since **each property has its own plan and billing cycle**, you can change the plan or billing cycle associated with a property at any time.

- **Switching plans** takes effect immediately.
- **Changing the billing cycle** also takes effect immediately:
  - If no similar subscriptions exist, a new billing cycle starts right away, and you’ll be charged a prorated amount (credit or debit, if applicable).
  - If other subscriptions of the same type already exist (monthly or yearly), the billing cycle aligns with their renewal date, and you’ll be charged a prorated amount (credit or debit, if applicable).

## Understand invoices

Invoices are issued a few days after each payment and are grouped by billing cycle type, regardless of the subscribed plan.  
If you have:
- Multiple monthly subscriptions, each month you'll receive a single monthly invoice grouping all subscriptions.
- Multiple yearly subscriptions, each year you'll receive a single monthly invoice grouping all subscriptions.

## Stopping Billing Cycles

All billing cycles are tied to active subscriptions.  
When you [cancel a subscription](../procedures/subscriptions_p.md#cancel-a-subscription), you stop the automatic renewal of its billing cycle.  
The subscription stays active **until the end of the current cycle**, after which:
- it won’t renew.
- the AI assistant will be unpublished.
