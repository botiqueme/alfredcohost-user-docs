# Plans & Billing Cycles

When choosing a plan on [our pricing page](https://alfredhospitalityai.com/pricing/), you can select a **billing cycle** — either **monthly** or **yearly** — for any of the available plans: **Essential Concierge** or **Premium Host**.

## Free Trial

Your first subscription includes a **15-day free trial**. At the end of the trial, your selected billing cycle will start automatically and be billed to the card you used when subscribing.

> **NOTE** You won’t be charged during the trial period. The first payment is made automatically when the trial ends.

## Changing Your Payment Card

You can update your saved payment card at any time by going to **My host profile** > **My saved card**.

> **IMPORTANT** Regardless of the billing cycle, any new card you add will take effect **starting from the next billing cycle**.

## Changing Plans & Billing Cycles

You can change the plan or billing cycle associated with a property at any time.  
Plan changes take effect immediately, while billing cycle changes apply at the next renewal date.

## Multiple Properties and Mixed Subscriptions

If you manage multiple properties, you can assign a **different subscription and billing cycle to each one**.  
For example, one property can be on the Essential plan with a monthly cycle, and another on the Premium plan with a yearly cycle — it's fully flexible.

When subscribing additional properties that share the same billing cycle as existing ones, you’ll only pay a **prorated amount** based on the current cycle.  
The new property’s billing cycle will align with the existing one.  
For example, if your first property is subscribed to the Essential Concierge plan (monthly) with a renewal date of January 31st, and you subscribe a second property on January 28th, you’ll only pay a prorated amount.

## Stopping Billing Cycles

All billing cycles are tied to active subscriptions.  
When you [cancel a subscription](../procedures/subscriptions_p.md#cancel-a-subscription), you stop the automatic renewal of its billing cycle.  
The subscription remains **active until the end of the current billing cycle**.  
After that, it won’t renew and the associated assistant will be unpublished.

## Invoices

Invoices are issued a few days after each payment and are grouped by billing cycle type, regardless of the subscribed plan.  
For example, if you have multiple subscriptions with different billing cycles, you’ll receive one invoice for all properties on a monthly plan, and one for all properties on a yearly plan.
