# Set up your library

Ready to get Alfred working for your guests? Great news: you 
don't need to prepare anything in advance. Alfred's library structure is already mapped out — you just fill in your property information. No prep needed, except for photos and videos if you want to include them (these need to be taken on-site).

> **NOTE** **New to Alfred Platform?** If you're starting from scratch, see [Get started](../get-started.md) for an overview of the complete setup process — from adding your first property to going live.

You can choose how deep you want to go. Start with a **Quick launch** setup that gets you live in 15 minutes, or take your time to build a **Full control** library that covers every detail. Both approaches work — it's all about what fits your timeline and needs.

## Quick launch setup (15 minutes)

Want to go live immediately? Focus on these three essential areas:

1. **Check-in information** — How guests get into the property, where to find keys, access codes, and arrival instructions
2. **Policies** — House rules, check-out procedures, and important guidelines guests need to know
3. **Accommodation information** — Basic property details like address, WiFi password, and key features

That's it. With just these three sections filled in, you'll have a **fully functional Alfred** that can handle the most common guest questions right away. You can always add more details later — but this gets you started and working with real guests in minutes.

> **TIP** This basic setup covers the basics of what guests typically ask. You're not cutting corners — you're getting smart about priorities.

## Full control setup (your own timeline)

Once you're live with the basics, you can expand your library at your own pace. Alfred gives you access to all item categories, so you can decide exactly how detailed you want to be:

- **Devices and appliances** — Step-by-step guides for using the TV, washing machine, coffee maker, and more
- **Household systems** — Troubleshooting for heating, A/C, electricity, water, and other systems
- **Local tips** — Restaurant recommendations, transport options, sightseeing spots, and neighborhood insights
- **Custom items** — Anything specific to your property that doesn't fit standard categories

The beauty? You control the granularity. Add a quick note about the WiFi, or write detailed troubleshooting steps for every appliance. Include photos and videos where they help, or keep it text-only. It's your call.

> **NOTE** Remember: photos and videos need to be taken on-site. Everything else — all the text-based information — comes from your knowledge of the property. No prep work needed.

## What you need (and what you don't)

**You need:**
- Your knowledge about the property — that's it
- Photos and videos (only if you want to include them) — these need to be taken on-site

**You don't need:**
- To prepare documents or materials in advance
- To write everything before you start
- To have all information ready at once

Alfred's platform is designed so you can start with the essentials and build from there. The item categories are already there, waiting for you to fill them in. Just open your property's library and start typing.

## Work on Alfred setup

Ready to set up your library? Here's how:

1. Go to **My Properties** > <img src="../media/library-icon.png" alt="book icon" style="height: 1em; vertical-align: middle;"> on the property you want to configure
2. Navigate the **Item Categories** and fill in the items that apply to your property

For the **15-minute setup**, focus on these essential categories:
- **Check-in** — How guests access the property, keys, codes, and arrival instructions
- **Policies** — House rules, check-out procedures, and important guidelines
- **Accommodation information** — Property address, WiFi password, and key features

Once you've covered these basics, you can continue with other categories like **Devices and appliances**, **Household systems**, **Local tips**, and **Custom items** to build a complete library.
