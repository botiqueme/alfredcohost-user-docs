# Properties

Properties in Alfred's platform reflect your real-life rentable units — that is, units guests can book, such as:
- an entire house or apartment  
- a room in a hotel, B&B, or hostel 
- a room in a guesthouse with shared areas  

When contacted, **Alfred will locate the guest in the correct property** and make sure **to provide answers based only on that specific property**.

## Creating a property

In the platform, go to **My properties** > **Add a property**. Enter a recognizable name for your property and click **Save**.

> **TIP!**
> For rooms in the same property, use a clear and consistent naming convention — something that matches how you refer to it in real life.  
> For example: **Old Town Rooms – Room A** if **Room A** is how you and your staff usually refer to it with guests.

## Next step

Once a property is created, you need to fill in its library — this is the information Alfred will use to provide tailored replies based on that property's specific features. Proceed to filling the [library](libraries_c.md).
