# Properties

Properties in Alfred's platform reflect your real-life rentable units — that is, units guests can book, such as:
- an entire house or apartment  
- a room in a hotel, B&B, or hostel 
- a room in a guesthouse with shared areas  

When contacted, **Alfred will locate the guest in the correct property** and make sure **to provide answers based only on that specific property**.

## Next steps

- Now that you understand how properties work, go set them up: [Manage properties](properties_p.md)
- Once a property is created, you need to fill in its library — this is the information Alfred will use to provide tailored replies based on that property's specific features. Proceed to filling the [library](libraries_c.md).
