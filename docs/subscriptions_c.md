# About Subscriptions

To enable Alfred Co.Host to speak about your properties, **each property needs to be associated with an active subscription**.

**Subscriptions** can be enrolled monthly or yearly and are billed in advance with automatic card payments with the card you associate with the payment. 

When you associate a property with a subscription, an AI assitant dedicated to that subscription is available all the time.

## Activate subscription

To activate a subscription go to **My properties** > find the property you want to subscribe for > activate the **Go live** toggle and select your plan.

## Cancel subscriptions

Subscriptions may be terminated at all times: to do so, go to **My subscriptions** > find the subscription you want to terminate > click **Delete**.

If you cancel your subscription, it will **remain active until the end of your current billing cycle**, and so will the published AI assistant. After that, your subscription will not renew and the AI assistant unpublished.

> **NOTE**
> Terminating a subscription **does not** delete the associated property and its library. For more about property deletion, see [how to delete a property]() procedure.

> **NOTE**
> Mistaken deletion? Simply [subscribe again](#activate-subscription)!
