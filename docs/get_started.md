# Get started

Welcome on board, and thanks for choosing Alfred Co.Host!  
In just a few simple steps, you’ll have your AI assistant ready to support your guests — 24/7, in every property.

## Step-by-step implementation

Getting your Hospitality AI assistant up and running has never been easier.  
As they say, three is the magic number — and that’s exactly how many steps it takes to go live with Alfred Co.Host.

### Step 1: Add a property

In Alfred Co.Host, each **property** represents one of your real-life rentals — an apartment, a suite, a holiday home.  
A property contains everything Alfred needs to assist your guests with the right answers. You can add, edit, duplicate, or remove properties at any time.

### Step 2: Add a library to your property

Each property has its own **library** — a space where you upload all the **pieces of information** your guests might ask about: how to check in, where to park, what’s the Wi-Fi code, and so on.  
These can be short texts, images, or videos. Alfred will use them to reply accurately, at the right time.

### Step 3: Go live!

That’s it — you’re ready!  
Once your property and library are complete, choose your subscription and **go live**.  
Alfred starts working immediately, turning your guest messages into smooth conversations.
