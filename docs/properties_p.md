# Work with properties

This page shows how to work with properties in the platform. If you’re not sure how Alfred uses properties, check the concept first: [What’s a property?](properties_c.md)

## Create a property

To create a property, go to **Manage my properties** > **Add a property**. Enter a recognizable name for your property and click **Save**.

> **TIP** For rooms in the same property, use a clear and consistent naming convention — something that matches how you refer to it in real life.  
> For example: **Old Town Rooms – Room A**, if **Room A** is how you and your staff usually refer to it with guests.

## Delete a property

> **WARNING** Deleting a property is irreversible!

To delete a property, go to **Manage my properties**, find the property you want to delete, and click the <img src="./media/delete-icon.png" alt="delete icon" style="height: 1em; vertical-align: middle;"> icon:
- **If the property has no active subscription**, it will be permanently deleted after a few minutes.
- **If the property has an active subscription**, deleting the property will also delete the subscription. The property will be permanently removed at the **end of the billing cycle**. Check your property billing cycle at **My Host Profile** > **My subscriptions**.
