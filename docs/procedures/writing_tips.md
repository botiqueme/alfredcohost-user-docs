# How to write great library items

Library items are the building blocks of your guest messages. They contain the information Alfred uses to communicate with guests.

For simple items like the **WiFi name** or **WiFi password**, you can simply enter a short value.

But when it comes to more complex information — such as the location of a device or instructions to troubleshoot an appliance — it’s important to write content that is clear, helpful, and easy to reuse.

> **IMPORTANT** While Alfred is very good at understanding your input, reading this guide will help you get the most out of it. If you’re unsure about your writing, don’t worry — Alfred is great at finding connections and interpreting your instructions with high accuracy!


## ✅ General principles

</br>

### 🎯 Start from the guest’s perspective

Think about:
- What is the guest trying to do?
- When will they need this information?
- Should this item instruct, inform, reassure, or guide?

> **Example** **Location of hot water controls**: “Under the boiler in the bathroom”

### 📍 Be precise about locations

Always write **clear, detailed locations** that help guests find things without asking.

> **Example** ❌ “In the kitchen”  
> ✅ “Inside the cabinet under the kitchen sink”

### 🖼️ Add photos and videos only when necessary

Images and videos are useful **only if** they make the explanation easier. Avoid overwhelming guests with unnecessary media.

Use dedicated fields like **photo**, **video**, or **instructions**. Don’t paste links inside the description.

## 🗣️ Tone of voice

</br>

### 📌 Use a friendly, neutral tone

Write as if you're explaining something to a guest in person. Be clear, but don’t overthink it. Avoid using all caps, abbreviations, or internal jargon.

> **Example** ❌ “Private parking: yes at corner”  
> ✅ “Private parking is available just around the corner from the building”

### 📌 Avoid vague words

Be direct. Don’t use words like “available”, “present”, or “see photo” — they don’t actually tell the guest where to look or what to do. Instead, give clear and specific details.

> **Example** ❌ “A hairdryer is available in the bathroom”  
> ✅ “You’ll find the hairdryer in the cabinet under the sink”
