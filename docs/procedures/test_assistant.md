## Test Alfred for a specific property

To test how Alfred responds for a specific property, go to **My Properties** and click the <img src="/docs/media/test-icon.png" alt="book icon" style="height: 1em; vertical-align: middle;"> icon next to the property you want to check.

From there, you can interact with a test version of Alfred that uses the information saved in that property’s Library.
