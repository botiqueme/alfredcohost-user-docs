# Hands off

When you subscribe a property, you're asked to provide two phone numbers: your **Phone number** and your **Hands off number**. Understanding the difference between these helps you set up Alfred correctly.

## Phone number vs Hands off number

**Phone number** is your main contact number. This is used for general account and billing communications.

**Hands off number** is the number where you or your staff will receive notifications when a guest needs human help. When Alfred escalates a conversation, notifications are sent to this number.

> **IMPORTANT** There's also a **Guest contact number** — set by Alfred Hospitality AI — that you share with your guests so they can contact Alfred via WhatsApp, Telegram, or other supported channels. You can see it in **My Properties** > <img src="../media/touchpoints.png" alt="communication channels icon" style="height: 1em; vertical-align: middle;"> next to each property.

## How hands off works

Alfred handles most guest questions automatically using your property's library. However, some situations require human attention — such as when a guest reports a problem, asks for special services, or needs help that goes beyond what Alfred can provide.

When this happens, Alfred **escalates** the conversation by:
1. Notifying you or your staff at the hands off number
2. Passing the conversation to a human agent
3. Providing context about what the guest needs

This ensures guests always get the help they need, whether from Alfred or from your team.

## When hands off happens

Hands off is triggered when:
- A guest reports a problem or issue
- A guest requests services that require human coordination
- The conversation needs personal attention beyond Alfred's automated responses
- Your policies specify that certain situations should be escalated

You can control when hands off happens by setting up [policies](../procedures/writing_policies.md) that tell Alfred when to escalate conversations.
