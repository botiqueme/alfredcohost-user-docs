# Property identifiers

Each property in Alfred Co.Host is defined by three identifiers that make it recognizable both internally and to your guests.  
**These identifiers are essential for Alfred to operate correctly**, as they allow the platform to link the right chatbot to the right apartment and ensure a seamless guest experience.

In this page you’ll learn about the three identifiers that enable Alfred’s automation and guest interactions:  
- The [Internal identifier](#internal-identifier), used only within your dashboard to keep property management organized.  
- The **Guest-facing identifiers** — the [Property guest name](#property-guest-name) and [Guest access PIN](#guest-access-pin) — which connect each guest securely to the right property assistant.


You can set or update these identifiers from **My Properties** > _select a property_ > <img src="./media/modify-property-icon.png" alt="modify property icon" style="height: 1em; vertical-align: middle;">.

## Internal identifier

The **Property Internal name** is used only by your team within the dashboard. It helps you and your staff recognize and refer to the property in a consistent way.

- Not visible to guests  
- Can follow any naming pattern that fits your internal logic (e.g., `WILLOWST77-1A` for `Willow Street 77, Apartment 1A`)  
- Must be unique across the platform  
- Useful to avoid confusion when managing several similar units  

> **TIP** Use clear and consistent internal names so your team can identify properties at a glance.


## Guest-facing identifiers

> **IMPORTANT** 
> **Read this section carefully!** It explains key concepts that directly affect how guests experience Alfred.

### Property guest name

When a guest contacts Alfred’s phone number, Alfred asks which apartment they are staying in and expects the **Property guest name**.

The **Property guest name** is displayed to guests in Alfred’s chat and in other guest-facing touchpoints such as Booking.com, Airbnb, or direct host communications.

- Visible to guests  
- Must be unique across the platform  
- Used by Alfred to connect the guest to the correct apartment chatbot  
- You can modify it at any time from **My Properties**

> **WARNING**
> - Use the exact same name guests see on Booking.com or Airbnb to keep communications consistent and avoid confusion.  
> - Always share the Property guest name together with the **Guest access PIN**, otherwise your guest won’t be able to access Alfred.


## Guest access PIN

The **Guest access PIN** is a short numeric code (e.g., *4739*) used to verify the guest as your customer.  
It prevents unauthorized users from accessing Alfred and ensures that only real guests can interact with your property’s assistant.

- Must be unique for each apartment  
- Shared manually with guests by the host  
- Acts as a lightweight security check before chat access is granted  
- You can modify it at any time from **My Properties**

> **WARNING**
> - Always share the PIN together with the **Property guest name**, otherwise your guest won’t be able to access Alfred.  
> - If you change the **Property guest name** or **Guest access PIN**, make sure to update your communications (emails, OTA messages, printed materials) accordingly to avoid guest confusion.
