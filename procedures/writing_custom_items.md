# Writing custom items

We've already mapped the key information your guests may need. You can add custom items to your [libraries](../concepts/libraries_c.md) anytime to cover extra details. Follow these tips to give Alfred the most accurate information about your property and policies.

## 💡 Think in placeholders

Write your items so they work seamlessly inside guest messages.

> **Example** 
> - **Garbage collection times**: “from 6:30 PM to 10:30 PM”  
> - **Guest message**: “Please remember that trash can be taken out {garbage_collection_times}.”

## 🥵 Don’t overload one item

Each library item should focus on **one clear piece of information**. Standard items are meant to hold just one piece of content. When creating custom items, make sure to separate different types of information into separate entries.

> **Example**  ❌ **Hot water information**: “Boiler above the bidet. Button below. If no hot water, open valve under kitchen sink.”  
>  </br>
> ✅ Split into multiple items:  
> - **Hot water system location**: “Above the bidet in the bathroom”  
> - **Hot water ON/OFF button location**: “Below the boiler in the bathroom”  
> - **Main water valve location**: “Under the kitchen sink”

## ✍️ Use step-by-step instructions when needed

For procedures like opening a lockbox or resetting the boiler, use short, numbered steps in a logical order.

> **Example** ✅ **Keybox instructions**:  
> 1. Turn the dials to match the code.  
> 2. Pull down the black lever.  
> 3. After use, scramble the code to keep it private.
