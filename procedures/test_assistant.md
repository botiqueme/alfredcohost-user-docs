# Test assistant

Before going live, you can test how Alfred responds to guest questions using your property's library content. This helps you see how your information works in practice and make sure everything is set up correctly.

## How to test Alfred

To test how Alfred responds for a specific property:

1. Go to **My Properties**.
2. Click the <img src="../media/test-icon.png" alt="test icon" style="height: 1em; vertical-align: middle;"> icon next to the property you want to test.
3. A test chat window opens where you can interact with a test version of Alfred.

The test assistant uses the information saved in that property's library, so you'll see exactly how Alfred will respond to your guests.

> **NOTE** Interactive features like voice messages or human handoff are not supported in the test chat. The test version focuses on testing how Alfred uses your library content to answer questions.

## What to test

Try asking questions your guests might ask, such as:
- How to check in
- Where to find the WiFi password
- How to use appliances or systems in the property
- Local recommendations
- Any custom information you've added

This helps you verify that Alfred can find and use your library content correctly before guests start using it.

> **TIP** If Alfred isn't responding as expected, check that your library items are clear, specific, and written from the guest's perspective. See our [writing tips](writing_tips.md) for guidance.
