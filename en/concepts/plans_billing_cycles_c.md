# Plans & billing cycles

When you subscribe on [our pricing page](https://alfredhospitalityai.com/pricing/) or in the Platform, you choose a **plan** and a **billing cycle** — either **monthly** or **yearly** — for each property.  
This page explains how to manage plans and billing cycles across your properties.

## Before you start: key concepts

Understanding these terms will help you follow the rest of this guide.

- **Plan** — The level of service for a property.  
  Example: *Essential Concierge* (basic features) or *Premium Host* (full features).

- **Subscription** — The active agreement linking a property to a plan. An active subscription is required for Alfred to interact with your guests.  
  Example: Subscribing *Seaside Villa* to a Premium Host plan.

- **Billing cycle** — The period of time covered by each payment (**monthly** or **yearly**).  
  Example: Monthly billing means you are charged every 30 days.

Each property has its own plan, subscription, and billing cycle — managed independently from those of other properties.  

If multiple properties share the same billing cycle type, the system automatically aligns their renewal dates and groups them into a single invoice.

## Billing cycles across properties

When you subscribe a new property, if there’s already an active subscription of the same type (monthly or yearly), its billing cycle automatically aligns with that of the **existing active subscription** of the same type.  
At the time of subscription, the system may calculate a prorated amount so the new cycle matches the existing one (more on prorated amounts in [Changing plans & billing cycles](#changing-plans--billing-cycles)).

Example:  
- You subscribe **Lakeview Apartment** on a yearly plan with a renewal date of **June 6**.  
- A few weeks later, you subscribe **Seaside Villa**, also on a yearly plan.  
- **Seaside Villa** automatically aligns with **Lakeview Apartment**’s billing cycle, so both renew on **June 6**.

This automatic alignment ensures that all properties with the same billing cycle type renew together. More about invoices in [Understanding invoices](#understand-invoices).

## Changing plans & billing cycles

You can change the plan or billing cycle for a property at any time.

- **Switching plans** takes effect immediately. New plan features (or limits) apply right away, and any price difference is calculated as a prorated charge or credit on your next invoice.
- **Changing the billing cycle** also takes effect immediately:
  - If no other subscriptions of the same type exist, a new billing cycle starts right away.
  - If other subscriptions of the same type exist, the new cycle aligns with their renewal date, and a prorated amount (debit or credit) is applied so they renew together.

> **NOTE** Any credit is applied to your next invoice, not refunded directly.

## End of a billing cycle

All billing cycles are tied to active subscriptions.  
When you [cancel a subscription](../procedures/subscriptions_p.md#cancel-a-subscription), you stop the automatic renewal of its billing cycle.  
The subscription stays active **until the end of the current cycle**, after which:
- it won’t renew.
- the AI assistant will be unpublished.

## Free trial

Your first subscription includes a **15-day free trial**.  
At the end of the trial, your selected billing cycle starts automatically and is billed to the card used at subscription.

> **NOTE** You won’t be charged during the trial. The first payment happens automatically when the trial ends.

## Understand invoices

Invoices are issued a few days after each payment and are grouped by billing cycle type, regardless of the subscribed plan.  
If you have:
- Multiple monthly subscriptions, each month you'll receive a single invoice grouping all monthly subscriptions.
- Multiple yearly subscriptions, each year you'll receive a single invoice grouping all yearly subscriptions.
