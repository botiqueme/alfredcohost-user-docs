# What Alfred can do

Alfred is your AI assistant that supports your guests 24/7 through messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram, and other supported channels. Here's what Alfred can do to help your guests and make your hosting operations smoother.

## Answer any question

Alfred can answer questions of any type your guests might ask. Whether they're asking about:

- How to check in or check out
- How to use appliances or systems in the property
- Local recommendations for restaurants, transport, or sightseeing
- House rules and policies
- Troubleshooting issues with devices or systems

Alfred uses the information you've added to each property's [library](libraries_c.md) to provide accurate, helpful answers tailored to that specific property.

> **TIP** The more complete and clear your library content is, the better Alfred can answer your guests' questions. See our [writing tips](../procedures/writing_tips.md) to learn how to create effective library items.

## Send photos and videos

Alfred can share photos and videos with your guests to help them understand instructions or find what they need. For example:

- Photos showing where to find appliances, keys, switches, or controls
- Video tutorials for using appliances or systems
- Images of the property exterior or nearby landmarks
- Visual guides for troubleshooting

You can add photos and videos to your library items, and Alfred will send them to guests when relevant to their questions. Learn more about [supported file formats](libraries_c.md#standard-media-information).

## Listen to voice messages

Guests can send voice messages to Alfred, and Alfred will understand what they're asking. However, Alfred always responds with written text messages, making it easy for guests to read and reference the information later.

This means guests can:
- Ask questions by speaking naturally
- Get clear, written answers they can refer back to
- Have a written record of important information

## Hands off to human support

Sometimes guests need help that goes beyond what Alfred can provide, or they may prefer to speak with a human. Alfred can **escalate conversations to your team** when needed.

When Alfred identifies that a guest needs human assistance, it will:

1. Notify you or your staff at your **Hands off number**
2. Let the guest know that a team member will help them
3. Provide context about the conversation so your team can assist effectively

This ensures that complex issues, special requests, or situations requiring personal attention are handled by your team, while Alfred continues to handle routine questions and support.

> **NOTE** You set your Hands off number when you subscribe a property. This is different from your main Phone number, which is used for account and billing communications.

## Always available

Alfred works 24/7, so your guests can get help at any time, day or night. This means:

- No waiting for business hours
- Immediate responses to common questions
- Consistent support across all your properties
- Reduced workload for you and your team
